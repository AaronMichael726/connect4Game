### Overview

To get your project idea approved for the Unit 1 project, you will begin developing your project's README file. The approval process will follow the steps below:

* Learn about README files and markdown
* Fork and clone this README for your project
* In your copy, fill out the following fields:
  * Title & Blurb
  * Motivation
  * User Stories & Wireframes
* Submit a pull request for project approval
* Get your project approved
* Copy this template to your project repository
* Complete your README as your project develops


### What is a README?

A README is a file that describes a project, program or app. It often includes information on technologies used, how to install or use the app, and code examples.

On GitHub, a README in your repo acts like an `index.html` file. If there is a README in a directory of a repo, the README will display as an HTML page.

### Markdown

Markdown is a plain text format for writing *structured* documents. It uses non-alphabetic characters to indicate simple styling choices. The simple syntax makes it easy to read in its raw format and converts easily to a formatted HTML document.

### GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)

GitHub Flavored Markdown, aka GFM, is a dialect of Markdown. It uses  the same syntax as Markdown with some additional features, e.g., direct embedding of HTML.

#### Basic Syntax
```markdown
h1 - h6 head tags
# = h1, ## = h2, etc.

**text** = bold
*text* = italic

[link text](absolute or relative url)

![image path](absolute or relative url)

```

#### Markdown Resources

Example:

# Project One: Connect Four
A fun 2 player game where players place tokens in a grid one after another with the goal of connecting four tokens in a row.

### Motivation
I am building this app to fulfill the requirements for project one of General Assembly SE Immersive.

### User Stories & Wireframes
The planning materials used to build this app.
* This is a two player game.  Player one should select a column and the token should drop to the bottom and land in the last free space.  Player two will then be prompted to drop the token. 
* once either player has four tokens in a row a positive message will display saying who one. 
* There are buttons to **Restart Game** AND **Enter Players Name** 

### Wireframes

### Technologies & Code Snippets
* The entire game can be made in javaScript, CSS, and HTML
